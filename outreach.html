								<h3>Per Aspera ad Astra: Through Hardships to the Stars </h3>
								<p> I have always been compelled to study astronomy, in large part because it feels so far removed (literally) from the day-to-day problems we face on
								Earth. I have been fortunate to have supportive advisors throughout my career. However, as a South Asian woman of color,
								I have experienced and witnessed toxic practices of gate-keeping starting as early as middle school. As a 
								result, a significant component of my work as a scientist includes advocating for the recruitment and partiuclarly the retention of folks from historically
								marginalized backgrounds through activities including targeted department initiatives, stem advocacy forums, and public observing nights. 
								You can read more about my outreach efforts below.  
								</p>
								
								<p> Just as I strive for diversity, equity, and inclusion in the field of astronomy, as a TA, I aim to make my classroom accessible
								and inclusive following the practices of my advisors and recommendations from education research.   
								</p>
