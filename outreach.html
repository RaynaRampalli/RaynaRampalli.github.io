								<h3>Per Aspera ad Astra: Through Hardship to the Stars </h3>
								<p> I have always been compelled to study astronomy, in large part because it feels so far removed (literally) from the day-to-day problems we face on
								Earth. I have been fortunate to have supportive advisors throughout my career. However, as a South Asian woman of color,
								I have experienced and witnessed toxic practices of gate-keeping starting as early as middle school. As a 
								result, a significant component of my work as a scientist includes advocating for the recruitment and partiuclarly the retention of folks from historically
								marginalized backgrounds through activities including targeted department initiatives, stem advocacy forums, and science communication. 
								You can read more about my outreach efforts below.  
								</p>
								
								<p> Just as I strive for diversity, equity, and inclusion in the field of astronomy, as a TA, I aim to make my classroom accessible
								and inclusive following the practices of my advisors and recommendations from education research.   
								</p>

								<h4> Selected Retention and STEM Advocacy Efforts</h4>
										
																			<ul>
												<li> Current Member of Dartmouth physics and astronomy equity, diversity, and inclusion
												working group.</li>
												
												<li> Current Alumna Liason with Wellsley College physics department connecting with current students 
												and speaking on panels.</li>
												
												<li> Co-organizer of Wellesley astronomy and physics departments’ post-baccalaureate dialogues: activities included
identifying and inviting speakers, managing department colloquia, and publicizing events.</li>

												<li> Initiated the project "Perspectives on the Wellesley College Physics Department: Where We’ve Been and Where
We’re Going" to formally document the history of women in physics of Wellesley College to foster faculty-student
conversations about curriculum. <a href="images/Physics Matters.pdf">Results</a> were presented at the annual Wellesley College Ruhlman Conference. Outcomes included faculty restructuring curriculum to better meet current students’ needs. </li>


<li> Conducted forums and workshops on STEM advocacy using the AAUW and NSF's  <a href="https://www.aauw.org/resources/research/the-stem-gap/">"Why So Few" research report</a> in Sacramento area high schools and California State University
Sacramento. </li>

<li> Congressional intern for Rep. Ami Bera and Rep. Doris Matsui focusing on STEM education. </li>

												
											</ul>
								
								

								<h4> Science Communication </h4>
								<p> In the process of trying to make physics and astronomy an inviting and accessible space
									for folks of all backgrounds, I have also volunteered at many public observing nights
									at the observatories in the Maria Mitchell Association, Wellesley College, Columbia University,
									and I hope soon at Dartmouth College post-pandemic. Sharing in the delight of the public when I get to
									use the telescopes to point to objects in the night sky,
									detail the history of the observatories, and explain astronomical concepts reminds me of 
									why I was drawn to this career in the first place. Thus, I also take great pride in sharing my
									science at places that were formative in the development of my interest in science 
									such as the <a href="https://powerhousesc.org/powerhouse-science-center-featured-on-capital-public-radios-insight-program/">Powerhouse Science Center</a> 
									and the <a href="http://www.sacstemfair.org/">Sacramento Science Fair</a>.
