								<h3>Per Aspera ad Astra: Through Hardship to the Stars </h3>
								<p> I have always been compelled to study astronomy, in large part because it feels so far removed (literally) from the day-to-day problems we face on
								Earth. I have been fortunate to have supportive advisors throughout my career. However, as a South Asian woman of color,
								I have experienced and witnessed toxic practices of gate-keeping starting as early as middle school. As a 
								result, a significant component of my work as a scientist includes advocating for the recruitment and partiuclarly the retention of folks from historically
								marginalized backgrounds through activities including targeted department initiatives, stem advocacy forums, and science communication. 
								You can read more about my outreach efforts below.  
								</p>
								
								<p> Just as I strive for diversity, equity, and inclusion in the field of astronomy, as a TA, I aim to make my classroom accessible
								and inclusive following the practices of my advisors and recommendations from education research.   
								</p>

								<h4> Retention and STEM Advocacy Efforts</h4>
										
																			<ul>
												<li> Current Member of Dartmouth Physics and Astronomy Equity Diversity and Inclusion
												Working Group</li>
												
												<li> Current Alumna Liason with Wellsley College Physics Dept. connecting with current students 
												and speaking on panels</li>
												
												<li> Co-organizer of Wellesley astronomy and physics departments’ post-baccalaureate dialogues: activities included
identifying and inviting speakers, managing department colloquia, and publicizing events.</li>
