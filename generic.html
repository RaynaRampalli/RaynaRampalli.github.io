								<h3>Current Interests and Work</h3>
								<p> I am interested in using stars as tools to understand planet and galactic evolution. We are at an exciting time in astronomy, where the many large-scale spectroscopic and photometric surveys of stars in our Galaxy
								have begun to unify and entangle the sub-fields of exoplanets, stars, and galaxies.  Much of my work is representative of this shift, including
									my current research with Professor <a href="https://newton.host.dartmouth.edu/" > Elisabeth Newton </a> at Dartmouth College, where we are using stellar rotation to age-date stars in order to determine the duty-cycles of transient spiral arms.
									Stay tuned for future updates.

								<h4>Understanding the Dimesnionality of Chemical Abundance Space for Galactic Archaeology</h4>
										<p>During my time as a Bridge scholar, I worked with Professor <a href="http://user.astro.columbia.edu/~mkness/Home.html" > Melissa Ness</a> to understand the dimensionality
											of chemical abundance information in the Gaia-RVS calcium-triplet-region spectra (expected in the third data release from the Gaia Mission). We fit a quadratic model of four primary sources of variability described by the stellar labels of effective temperature, surface gravity,
											metallacity, and alpha-enrichment to the flux of spectra from the Gaia-RVS-like ARGOS survey. We find that models capture 85% of variance in the ARGOS spectra and that the
										largest residuals are concentrated around the calcium lines, as confirmed by a principal component analysis. This result likely marks departures from the completeness of the 1D-LTE label
										assumption. Using the same four-label model with the Gaia-RVS-like RAVE-on Catalog, we check to see if we can infer measured Si, O, Ca, Ni, and Al abundances and find that we can. Running the same test with
											the higher-resolution APOGEE survey, we find that a measurement uncertainty of <0.03 dex is required to capture additional information from these elements. Thus, a four-label model
											is sufficient in describing chemical abundance variance for SNR < 200 in Gaia-RVS spectra.

								<h4> Rotation Period Stability in Praesepe </h4>
								<p> My primary project as a Bridge scholar involved measuring rotation period stability for low-mass stars in the 670-Myr open cluster, Praesepe, with
										Professor <a href="http://user.astro.columbia.edu/~marcel/" > Marcel Ag√ºeros</a>. Gyrochronology, or the use of stellar rotation to infer ages
										of low-mass stars, has been shown to be a promising age-dating method for stars of unknown ages. As stars age, they lose angular momentum as a result of their magnetic fields carrying
										away stellar material. This in turn slows their rotation at a predictable timescale that we determine by empirically calibrating age-rotation relations using stellar populations of known ages (e.g. open clusters).
										In order to measure stellar rotation, we rely on modulations in stellar light curves as a result of star spots periodically orbiting in and out of our view. Therefore, it
										is important to ensure the period we measure from photometry is intrinsic to the star rather than a particular spot alignment at the time. We test this by measuring
										rotation periods for Praesepe stars with 2-3 sets of observations taken by the K2 mission. We find that in > 95% of the cases we are able to measure the 
										same period within an average of 0.3% indicating that a rotation period measurement is in fact representative of the star's intrinsic behavior. In this process,
										we also measure periods for > 200 additional rotators, including 33 found in the newly discovered tidal tails of the cluster. </p>

								<h4>K2-308b: An NGC 1817 Interloper </h4>
								<p>As part of my senior thesis, I worked with Professor <a href="http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~vanderburg/" > Andrew Vanderburg</a>, Dr. Dave Latham, Dr. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/quinnsam/" > Sam Quinn</a>, and <a href="https://lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/~abieryla/" > Allyson Bieryla</a>
									to test techniques for improving planet candidate validation in star-crowded fields of the K2 mission. This was done to prepare for the issues forseen with the large pixels of the TESS mission. In this process, we discovered K2-308b, a hot saturn-sized planet thought to be associated with the 1-Gyr-old open cluster NGC 1817. Planets found in
									open clusters are extremely valuable since the age of the host star is easily determined and thus helps us constrain timescales for various planet formation and evolution scenarios. While we ultimately find that the 
									planet's star is a field star incorrectly presumed to be a cluster member using Gaia DR2 astrometry, we note that a technique tested in my senior thesis, seeing-limited photometry, is a useful method for planet candidate validation,
									particularly in croweded fields. Read the paper <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AJ....158...62R/abstract" > here. </a>

								<h4>Other Work</h4>
								<p> I would be remiss if I did not mention the other research I was fortunate enough to have engaged in as an undergraduate and high-school student. </p>
										<p> The summers after my first and sophomore year were spent at the Maria Mitchell Observatory (MMO) and NASA Ames as an REU Intern. At MMO, I worked with
										Professor John Salzer to detect ahd tabulate point-sources of H-alpha emission
										serendipitously found in images from the 2.1m WIYN telescope. Read the associated paper <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJS..253...39W/abstract" > here. </a>
										The following summer, at Ames, I worked with Joe Catanzarite and Prof. Natalie Batalha to calculate the occurrence rate of hot Jupiters
										incorporating observational reliability. I found a 10% lower rate than what was reported in prior literature. You can read my AAS abstract 
										<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AAS...22924522R/abstract" > here </a> and and watch my REU "lightning talk" <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=log-XBhHFvM" > here </a> (22:11). </p>
										<p> In high school, I was lucky enough to conduct observations and analysis of exoplanet transits in the <a href="https://www.astronomycamp.org/information.html" > Advanced Astronomy Camp </a> 
										and the <a href="https://cosmos-ucop.ucdavis.edu/app/main" > UC COSMOS Program </a> at UC Davis. Inspired by these experiences, I worked with Professor <a href="https://starlab.mit.edu/" > Kerri Cahoy </a> at MIT to develop curve-fit multi-polynomial regression functions to analyze Kepler light curves
										and determine a quantifiable relationship between transit shape and planet radius.</p>
